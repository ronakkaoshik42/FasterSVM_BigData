In order to run the code, these python3 libraries should be present on the system

1. cvxpy
2. numpy
3. pandas
4. matplotlib
5. scikit-learn
6. tqdm

The notebook consists of the entire set of experimentation involved in the report provided. 
You can run all the cell blocks in a go and check the results.
Make sure to not re-run the intermediate blocks because they might have an order requirement to run the code effeciently.

For the selective sampling approach we have included some additional results that test out the method on the other classes. 
Please have a look at the other_classes_results.csv for the same. Our method works quite well for all of these other classes.
